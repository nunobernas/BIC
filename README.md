# BIC
This tool is designed to simplify and automate the process of reporting security flaws detected, using the OWASP-ASVS checklist, to JIRA. It allows the security experts to automatically generate issues from the checklist to perform audits and tests of security controls in a web application. 

For more details on how the tool works, see the Technical Manual Template for BIC in the repository.

For the tool to work correctly it is required to have Python >=3.8 installed.
